a simple flash cards app in favor of my interest in learning Japanese.

php version was created in 2013. It was actully an html/jQuery application. php part was used to retrive data from sql database.
react version is remade in 2016 using react/redux and javascript.

I still have not learned basic Japanese after 3 years has passed. :(
However, I have learned react/redux and a better javascript style. :)
